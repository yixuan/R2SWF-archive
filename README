This is an R package to convert several formats of images to a
Flash file(swf).

R2SWF depends on the following libraries:

    zlib         http://www.zlib.net/
    libpng       http://www.libpng.org/
    libming      http://www.libming.org/

However, the source code of the dependent libraries are included in the package,
so you don't need to install them by yourself.

To install the 'package' here:

install.packages('Rd2roxygen')
setwd('where/is/R2SWF')
library(Rd2roxygen)
rab('R2SWF', install = TRUE)
