This is an R package to convert several formats of images to a
Flash file(swf).

R2SWF depends on the following libraries:

    zlib         http://www.zlib.net/
    libpng       http://www.libpng.org/
    libming      http://www.libming.org/

However, the source code of the dependent libraries (with minor modifications) are included in the package,
so you don't need to install them by yourself.

To install the 'package' here:

## For users: 
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('R2SWF', 'yihui')

## For developers
install.packages('Rd2roxygen')
library(Rd2roxygen)
rab('path/to/R2SWF', install = TRUE)
