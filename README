This is an R package to convert several formats of images to a
Flash file(swf) using swfmill(http://swfmill.org/).

R2SWF depends on the following libraries:

    libxml2      http://xmlsoft.org/
    libxslt      http://xmlsoft.org/
    zlib         http://www.zlib.net/
    freetype     http://www.freetype.org/
    libpng       http://www.libpng.org/

For Unix-like OS, be sured that these libraries along with the
development files are installed.

For Windows, the source code of these libraries are included
in the package, so you do not need to build them yourself.  


To install the 'package' here:

install.packages(c('Rd2roxygen', 'formatR'))
setwd('where/is/R2SWF')
library(Rd2roxygen)
rab('R2SWF', install = TRUE)
