This is an R package to convert several formats of images to a
Flash file(swf) using swfmill(http://swfmill.org/).

R2SWF depends on the following libraries:

    libxml2      http://xmlsoft.org/
    libxslt      http://xmlsoft.org/
    zlib         http://www.zlib.net/
    freetype     http://www.freetype.org/
    libpng       http://www.libpng.org/

For Unix-like OS, be sure that these libraries along with the
development files are installed.

For Windows, the dependent libraries will be downloaded automatically when building this package.

To install the 'package' here:

install.packages(c('Rd2roxygen', 'formatR'))
setwd('where/is/R2SWF')
library(Rd2roxygen)
rab('R2SWF', install = TRUE)
